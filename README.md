## Open Git Pull Requests  


## Overview  

It’s time to stitch the front and the back ends. In fact we’ll break the back end in two and stitch that together as well.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements  

- [] Deploy API to Heroku in a Docker container
  - API resource can be simple
- [] Deploy NextJS Front end to Vercel // See journal-next repo
- [x] Deploy PostgreSQL database to ElephantSQL
- [] Get them all to work together as a CRUD app

## Implementation Notes:  

- [] Set up a free account with Vercel  
- [] Set up a free account with ElephantSQL  
- [] Make sure Heroku is in working order.  
  - Install Heroku CLI

## User Acceptance Tests  

- Single (manual) test for today. It should work!
